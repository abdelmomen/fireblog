Dubai is a destination which blends contemporary culture with history and adventure with world-class shopping and entertainment. Pick up the exhibition in Dubai Opera House, see the city center from the top of the Burj Khalifa and spend the afternoon all the Dubai Creek to explore gold jewelry, textiles and spice markets.

And if you're looking for excitement, you can go surfing above the sand dunes desert in a hot air balloon, climb aboard a high-speed flight in the world and have a good time of adventure or skydiving on Palm Jumeirah.

[The best hotels in Dubai](http://hotelsofdubai.site/en/we-promise-the-best-of-dubai/) could be the luxurious hotels of the city or maybe for some people the oriental places which give you the eastern culture and experience.

## Things to Do in Dubai ##

 - Visit the Dubai mall to do shopping but consider that it's very expensive, and there's not much there that isn't available at home.
 - Visit Dubai fountains with nice fountain show similar to Las Vegas. it can get a bit disturbing with the half hour repetition in the evening.

 - See Dubai Marina Yacht Club This area is great for eating. We had a taxi driver take us from the Maria to the marina mall, don't believe them when they say it is a ten minute walk, just get a cab.
